## Hi, I am Firdavs

I am an entry-level cybersecurity professional with a strong commitment to protecting networks and data from evolving threats. After earning the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, I gained practical skills in threat analysis, incident response, vulnerability assessment, and security auditing. My hands-on experience includes labs on network traffic analysis with Wireshark and tcpdump, brute force and DoS attack simulations, managing permissions and authorizations, and implementing security frameworks such as NIST CSF and PASTA.

I am passionate about proactive threat hunting, learning emerging security tools and techniques, and collaborating with teams to build secure and resilient systems. Currently, I am seeking opportunities to apply my skills as a cybersecurity analyst or apprentice, contributing to organizational security while advancing my expertise in the field.
